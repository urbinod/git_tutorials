# Git Tutorials

## Create new repository

```http
  https://github.com/new
```

# Following are the steps

### step 1 (Download into my local from internet repository (git clone <url>)

```http
  git clone https://github.com/urbinod/git_command_tutorials.git

```

### step 2 (List all the files into current directory)

```http
  $ ls
```

### step 3 (Move into directory)

```http
  $ cd foldername
```

### step 4 (Create new file from terminal using touch)

  <p>$ touch product.html</p>
  <p> $ git add <filename></p>
  <p> $ git add . (To add all files) </p>

### step 5 (Now we need to commit - Save the snapshot of the file)

```http
  $ git commit -m "message"
```

### step 6 (Now we need to commit - commit all files)

```http
  $ git commit -am "message"
```

### step 7 (To see what is currently happening in my git repository)

```http
  $ git status
```

### step 8 (check whether the your branch is up to date to master before push)

```http
  $ git pull
```

### step 9 (Now we need to commit - Save the snapshot of the file)

```http
  $ git push
```

#### When someone changes the same file eg: product.html and you are modifying the same file when we git pull, we will have conflict. Make change in conflict file to which file you wants and commit the file as $ git commit -am “messge” and git push

#### git log (show the list of commit id , author, date, who have added)

#### git reset (Git reset in effect will take the current state of the repository and revert it back to an older state of the repository)

```http
  $ git reset
  either $ git reset - - hard <commit>
  or either $ git reset - - hard origin/master
```
